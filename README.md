# Anime Recommendation System

## Capstone Project

**Author**: Edgar Gonzalez

### Overview

With an ever increasing number of titles coming out every year, The Anime genre is getting bigger and becoming much more mainstream. 
Several companies have already noticed and started to create their own Anime specific streaming services or producing their own shows. 
Anime has gotten so large that it contains its own subgenres. To help newer fans and fans who want to find a title that fits their personal 
tastes among thousands of titles, I created a recommender system using user-based collaborative filtering and content filtering, to find 
titles that a user would like the best, based on how high they rated shows they arleady watched

### Data 

Datasets used can be found in the repository in `Anime_data` folder which was found on Kaggle.


### Methods

Created and changed certain features in the dataset to uncover correalation between price of house and the features of a house.
Used various statistical tests to evaluate changes in features and whether they were significant or not.

### Results
Created a function which uses a singular value decomposition model (SVD) to make predictions on which Anime the user would rate highly 
based on on the user previously rated titles and their similarity to other users
